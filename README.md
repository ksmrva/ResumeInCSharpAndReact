Hello! Welcome to my resume app. I wrote this using .NET 8.0/C# 17 for the backend and React 18 for the frontend. 
The data handling is extremely simple and is just a simple in-memory repository feeding the front-end static data.
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to learn new languages quickly and efficiently, especially C# and React which are quite intuitive. 
I spent the previous 10 years as a Java developer and wanted to showcase my ability to transition into new territory using my extensive experience. 
Thank you for visiting!
